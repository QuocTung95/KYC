## Development

- Via docker

* If you make changes to the code and want to rebuild the containers, use the `--build` flag:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The app will be available at:

Frontend: http://localhost:3000

Backend: http://localhost:8080

- To view container logs, use:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

## Troubleshooting

- If ports `3000` or `8080` are already in use, you may need to stop the services using those ports or adjust the ports to the other port

- Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running correctly.

## Conclusion

This README file provides basic steps to run the full MVP Portal project using Docker and Docker Compose. Make sure to follow the instructions carefully, and you should have both the frontend and backend services running locally.
